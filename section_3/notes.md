# Section 3

Javascript uses dynamic typing, which means the following code is valid:
``` Javascript
var testVar = 'test';
testVar = true;
testVar = 1
```
but some languages use static typing so the variable can only hold the type of value it was declared with.

Primitive Types:
  - Undefined - represents lack of existence, but don't set a variable to this
  - Null - represents lack of existence, you can set your variables to this value
  - Boolean - ```true``` or ```false```
  - Number - floating point number, there's always some decimal
  - String - sequence of characters
  - Symbol - used in ES6
